Paper and code snippets by Sam Ericksen

Images processed in WebODM using the defualt "Forest" parameters

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
rgl::setupKnitr(autoprint = TRUE)
options(rgl.useNULL = TRUE)

```

## Package Setup

First we need to load in a number of packages to work with the LiDAR data. Remember to use `install.packages()` to install/update any non-current packages on your system.

```{r packages,echo=1:4, message=FALSE, error=FALSE}
library(lidR)
library(lidRplugins)
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgl)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Reading a Point Cloud

First, using the LidR package, we read in the dataset in question. In this case, to make the script more universally available for all users we use the `choose.file()` function. This function opens a file explorer box that allows the user to choose any file from there computer as they wish. We also want to do a quick initial validity test on the data - simply plotting it.

```{r psuedo las, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
las <- readLAS("C:/Users/samer/OneDrive/Documents/R/ForestInv_DoubleSample_Ellwood/Agisoftfeb25highmodelpointcloud/WebODM_Stuff/College-of-the-Redwoods-Eureka-Campus-2-17-2022-georeferenced_model.laz")
```

```{r read pointcloud, error=FALSE,warning=FALSE, echo=c(1:3) }
#las <- readLAS(file.choose(), select = "xyz")

plot(las) ## initiates a 3D plot, must be run in R
rglwidget()
```

We can also run a deep check on the las to see if any issues are present that may impede future analysis using `las_check()`. It's also nice to check and see if the file is already normalized visually, this can be done by plotting the minimum height values.

```{r check pointcloud, eval=2:8}
las_check(las)

epsg(las) ##get the coordinate system of the file.  Here we get 32610, which has a vertical unit of meters, so we know the Z values will be in meters

plot(pixel_metrics(las, ~min(Z), res = 10))

min(las@data$Z)
```

Here both `las_check()` and a plot of minimum height values indicate a non-normalized point cloud (all values are above 0 meters). Additionally, the deep check of the file indicates a few interesting anomalies that need to be addressed:

-   There are a few duplicate points that should be filtered out
-   Ground points are not classified
-   There is some issue with the RGB data, but this is likely only an issue for LidR, and can be ignored for now

Duplicates can be filtered very quickly:

```{r duplicate filter}
las <- filter_duplicates(las)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Classifying Ground Points

When working with point clouds derived from photogrammetry, there is often no classifications initially associated with the points. ASPRS provides a [structure for classification of point clouds](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/viewer.html?pdfurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asprs.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2010%2F12%2FLAS_Specification.pdf&clen=3783348&chunk=true) to work with, but for now our main concern are ground points. Without ground points classified it is not possible to create a canopy height model, as the canopy height is derived in relation to the ground surface.

When we plotted the point cloud earlier we noticed that there aren't many points under the canopy, this makes ground classification a little tricky. Fortunately, there were ground points collected on the outskirts of the area of interest, so we can work with that.

Because of the lack of ground under the canopy we will use a Cloth Simulation Filter . There are a few attributes that can be adjusted by the user, and the most important in this case is cloth rigidness, although 2L is generally for flat ground, to force some interpretation of the under-canopy ground we will use this setting. Once ground points are classified we plot just the ground points (ASPRS class 2L) to see how it performed.

```{r classify gound}

las <- classify_ground(las, csf(rigidness = 2L))

plot(pixel_metrics(las[las@data$Classification==2L], ~mean(Z), res = 2))

plot(las[las@data$Classification==2L])
```

Plotting the average height value of the ground points shows that there are clearly some miss-classified ground points back where the canopy is very dense (Northeast corner). It looks like we can safely remove ground points above 40m during creation of a canopy height model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Creating a Canopy Height Model

The first step in creating a canopy height model will be the creation of a digital terrain model (DTM). There are a three methods of this included in the LidR package:

-   K-Nearest Neighbor Methods

    -   Inverse Distance Weighting

    -   Krigging

-   Delaunay Triagulation

```{r DTM creation, echo=1:5, fig.show='hold',}
grnd_points <- filter_poi(las, Classification == 2L, Z < 40) ##filter point cloud to include only non-anomalous ground points

idw_terrain <- rasterize_terrain(grnd_points, algorithm = knnidw())
krig_terrain <- rasterize_terrain(grnd_points, algorithm = kriging())
tin_terrain <- rasterize_terrain(grnd_points, algorithm = tin())

par(mfrow = c(2,2))

raster::plot(idw_terrain, 
             main = "Inverse Distance Weighting DTM")
raster::plot(krig_terrain, 
             main = "kriging DTM")
raster::plot(tin_terrain, 
             main = "Delaunay Trianglation DTM")
```

Here we can see the Kriging does not deal with extrapolation well with default parameters. IDW and TINing seem to give reasonable outputs and a closer inspection seems to indicate that TINing gave a smother slope transition when extrapolating under-canopy ground points. We will continue with the canopy height model using the DTM created using TINing, but one couldn't be blamed for considering using the IDW terrain model either.

```{r canopy height model, warning=FALSE}
## normalize the point cloud heights
las_norm <- normalize_height(las, algorithm = tin_terrain)
plot(pixel_metrics(las_norm, ~max(Z), res = 2))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Classify Noise

Upon close inspection of the dataset there does appear to be some non-contiguous points, specifically near tops of trees. Ground control tree measurements, taken by Oren Nardi, indicate the tallest tree to be around 150', while the current maximum normalized height is over 170'. It is possible that some of this is due to noise from photogrammatic processing.

### Trimming Extents

The first thing we want to do is trim the extents of the point cloud to the area of interest. We can use our map from earlier to get some extents from:

```{r map of area, echo=FALSE}
lidR::plot(pixel_metrics(las_norm, ~mean(Z) , res = 1 ))
```

Here it looks like the extents of the forest are about (399110 ,4505920, 399280, 4506080)

```{r plot map}

las_norm_clip <- clip_rectangle(las_norm, 399110,4505920, 399280, 4506080)

plot(pixel_metrics(las_norm_clip, ~mean(Z), res = 1))
```

Great, that's a pretty good cut bounding box for the forested area. Now we need to filter out flat areas, as local maximum filters will pick up slight variations in these areas and miss-classify them as trees.

### Removing Non-Tree Values

Looking at the map above it is pretty clear that no trees are under 5m with enough overlap to be captured in photogrammetry. So we can filter those out, and we can also filter out ground points.

```{r remove nonTree values, echo=c(1:2)}
las_Trees <- filter_poi(las_norm_clip, Classification != 2L, Z > 10)

#plot(las_Trees)
#rglwidget()
```

### Noise Classification

The lidR package supports two methods for noise classification, Statistical Outliers Removal (SOR) which just removes points that are considered outliers by being some multiple of standard deviations from the mean height, or an Isolated Voxels Filter (IVF) which voxelizes the point cloud, and removes cuboids of points which have less than a specified number of points in their surrounding voxels.

We can see in the previous 3D plot that most of our outlying points are actually detached from from neighbors. This is the method we will use as many of our outlying points are dis-contiguous from our forest points.

Finally we smooth the cloud out slightly, just as a measure to avoid multiple maxima in small areas (sometimes caused by split crowns or noisy points)

```{r noise classification, echo=c(1:5), message=FALSE}

las_trees_ivf <- las_Trees %>% 
  classify_noise(ivf(res = .5,  n = 40)) %>% 
  filter_poi(las_Trees@data$Classification!=18)

smooth_ivf <- smooth_height(las_trees_ivf, 1, 'gaussian', 'circle', sigma = 2)

plot(smooth_ivf)
rglwidget()
```
